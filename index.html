  <h1>Checkers</h1>
  
  <h2>Rules:</h2>
  
    <ol>
      <li>Moves can only be made diagonally.</li>
      <li>When moving without capturing a piece, you may only move one square.</li>
      <li>When capturing, a player moves diagnoally over the captured piece. If you have the ability to capture, you must.</li>
      <li>You can make multiple jumps in a single turn, if the position of the piece allows.</li>
      <li>When a piece reaches the opposing side of the board, it is kinged and may move both forward and backward.</li>
      <li>The game is won when the opponent is unable to make a move. This can happen one of two ways: the entirety of a player's pieces were captured by the opponent, or a player's pieces are all blocked from moving.</li>
    </ol>
