1. Start game
  -Have game load and initialized, prepared for first move
  -Organize necessary variables and event listeners

2. Be notified of which player's turn it is
  -Create a variable for whose turn it is
    -As soon as one player goes, update variable to the other player

3. Be able to move a piece by clicking on it
  -Create a class for the pieces
    -Create an array for storage of user's pieces
    -Create a property for the current position of all the pieces
    -Loop through all of the user's pieces
      -Need event listener for each one
  -If a piece is chosen, assign it to a variable "chosenPiece"
    -If piece is moved, change the position property for that piece
  -Render the board to display new positioning of the chosen piece

4. Be able to only make valid moves
  -Create object to show possible moves
    -All valid squares can be represented by a number
  -Create array for available moves
  -Create array for moves that could result in capturing opponent's piece
  -Loop through each piece to find which squares are viable moves
    -Separate arrays for each player
  -Loop through the possible moves returned to check if opponent has a piece on that square
    -Look for possible captures of opponent's pieces
      -If no possible captures, loop through returned moves to check for empty squares
  -After a move is made, check for a captured piece
    -If yes, check for more possible captures with the chosen piece
  -If no possible moves are left, the game is over

5. Captured pieces are removed
  -Each piece will be given property "isInPlay" with a default "true"
    -"isInPlay" will be set to false if a piece has been captured
  -Piece's location will have to be "null"
  -Render board to no longer show the piece that was just captured

6. Pieces that reach back row turn "king"
  -Every piece gets "isKing" property, with default false setting
    -turns true if piece reaches opponent's back row

7. Check for finished game 
  -Loop through every avialble piece for any possible remaining moves
    -If no moves are left, end loop for the game
  -Loop through to see if all pieces for a user have been captured
    -If no pieces are left, end loop for the game
  -Display winner message

8. Restart game button
  -Add event listener to "Restart" button
    -Resets the loop of the game
